The initial decision was to have these individuals appointed to a one year term, however, with the continuation of the pandemic, we are extending their terms through the remainder of 2022.
 
Redgate maintains a permanent seat on the board, but has only one vote inside the organization.

As the foundation establishes itself, more information will be available.
